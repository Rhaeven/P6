1. What new forces did you add to affect the behavior
of a flock? How did you tie in the genetic values?

Food search behavior was implemented to affect
the behavior of the flock. Angle of vision and range of
vision were among the food search behavior. Also a
behavior that avoided the mouse cursor was implemented.
This was tied into the genetic values as genetic
values. 

2. Describe your two fitness functions. What do they
try to optimize? Try evolving flocks for several
generations under each. How successfully do the flocks
evolve to fit the desired outcomes from these selective
pressures? Can you outperform the evolutionary process
by adjusting flock genomes by hand?

The fitness functions involved the flap rate and the
difference in the color hues. The flocks evolve
relatively well to fit the desired outcomes from these
selective pressures. Boids begin to evolve to flap
much more than their ancestors, and they begin to display
a sharper color contrast in their appearances.

One way to outperform the evolutionary process by hand
is by using the mouse cursor to selectively prevent boids
that don't fit the fitness functions from getting to the
food. 

3. Experiment with evolving flocks using only mutation,
only crossover, and a mix of both. Describe your findings
in how the evolutionary mechanisms differ over time. 

Using only mutation:
      Changes are erratic and take a lot of generations
      before meaningful conclusions can be made.

Only crossover:
     Changes are a lot more deliberate, but seem to
     fall under very safe categories. Most of the boids
     seem to appear very similar.

A mix of both:
      This is the optimal mix of crossing and mutating.
      It seems like the most realistic implementation
      of actual evolution.
